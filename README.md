# STA305 Design and Analysis of Experiments
This project investigates the impact of position, angle, and timing in 100-pin bowling for Nintendo Wii Sports Resort through a replicated 2^3 factorial experiment. Statistical analyses were performed including interaction plots and regression. The result of the experiment found that the 3 factors were insignificant.

This project was done for a third-year course, STA305 Design and Analysis of Experiments, at the University of Toronto during my undergraduate studies.
